# Prediction_using_Unsupervised_learning
Here, I made a model that do prediction by unsupervised learning. 
Here, we use K value that denote how many cluster we need and according to that we make cluster and done our prediction. 
In that last, I shows you my Decision tree from that you can get things more properly. 
Thanks you
